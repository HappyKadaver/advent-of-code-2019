# advent-of-code-2019

This repository contains my solutions for advent of code 2019.
The directory structure is:

 * <day fixed 2 numbers>
     * input.txt
     * 1
        * <code for part 1>
     * 2
        * <code for part 2>
        
The programming language may change for each day or every part as I feel like it.
